## this is written in haste and may contain errors
the thing is, this is not really a poem as much as it is a proof of concept... a test of software... or simply a way to **try to get ideas across** in a way that lets the rest of my day follow without any of the frustration and... I'm going to stop there.

It's 4:30PM.

It's nearly time to go.

I keep hitting the slash key at the end of sentences/

	it should really be a perioud. (sp)
    
    Stop.
