**This is going to sound strange.** And it is strange. It’s a really strange,
weird, out there, crazy theory. Still, as the sliding scale of influence
slips slowly away from the fixity of print and toward the fluidity of
networked information one thing is becoming clear to me: publishers need
to stop thinking about the reader.

OK, maybe not stop thinking about the reader, but rather start thinking
about how the world the reader lives in _**continues**_ to change. We need to
come to terms with the fact that we all live in a state of constant
churn where the possible touchpoints for our editorial multiply faster
than we can effectively service them. We can’t simply take our current
processes and switch the output to “Digital” and call it a day. We are
not living through a change in substrate. We are living through a change
in how we tell our stories who we tell them to.

For centuries the rhythms of publishing have been dictated by the
affordances of print. The slow, methodical distribution of printed
information, coupled with its status as a non-rival good, led to the
formation of a compacted publishing process. It was this compaction that
fostered an artificially close relationship between the publisher and
the reader, which in turn led to a common workflow with an intrinsic
bias toward graphic design. Presented with the opportunity to convey
ideas not only through words on a page but also through striking visual
juxtaposition it wasn’t long before editors and publishers started
producing something entirely new–the magazine.

As long as that particular machine continued to operate as one of the
primary engines of cultural and social information, publishers could
rely on the editorial supply chain that grew around it. Yet as we all
know the printing press has been having a hard time retaining its
dominance as an engine of cultural and social information. The
relentless drive of networked information technologies has steadily
chipped away at the influence of print media and in the process has
exposed the editorial supply chain built on top of it as a one-trick
pony.

Nowhere is this more visible than in the fledgling attempts by many
publishers to go digital. Without a doubt these attempts are necessary
and worthwhile, but they are an extension of an antiquated, product
oriented way of thinking. They represent an awareness that change is
happening, but they don’t do much to address the depth of the change.
These new digital products stem from the same manufacturing processes
that produce the print object and in that respect are not fundamentally
new. They are not an answer to the problem of the slow decline of print,
but rather an indicator of how completely the affordances of print have
captured how we think about publishing.i
